This project was developed as a term project assignment for the Information Retrieval course at HiLCoE School of Computer Science and Technology. The project aimed to explore the functionalities of Amharic stemming and its application in an information retrieval system.

## Amharic Stemmer and Information Retrieval System

This repository implements an Amharic language stemmer and a basic Information Retrieval (IR) system.

**Stemmer:**

The stemmer takes Amharic words as input and outputs their stems. This helps improve search accuracy in the IR system by reducing inflected words to their root forms.

**Information Retrieval System:**

The IR system utilizes the Amharic stemmer to process documents stored in the `Documents` folder. Users can then search for keywords within these documents. The system retrieves documents containing stemmed versions of the search keywords.

**Getting Started:**

(Instructions on how to run the stemmer and IR system, specific to your project's implementation)

**Documents Folder:**

The `Documents` folder contains the text files used by the IR system. You can add your own Amharic documents to this folder for searching.

**Further Development:**

(Optional: Mention any future plans for the project, like improvements to the stemmer or IR system)
